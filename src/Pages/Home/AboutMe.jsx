                    <p className="hero-section-descrpiton">I’m a Computer Engineering graduate from Pamukkale University, where I was actively involved in the Pausiber student community. As a member, I contributed to various software-related initiatives, including workshops and seminars, fostering collaboration and continuous learning. My passion for software development has driven me to explore diverse technologies and constantly improve my skills.</p>
                    <p className="hero-section-descrpiton">Beyond coding, I’m an avid fan of science fiction and fantasy geek culture, always seeking new worlds and stories to dive into. I also enjoy a good game of chess, which helps me sharpen my problem-solving and strategic thinking abilities.</p>
